     * To generate an access token, you must provide one of the following:
     *
     * - An authorization code
     * - A refresh token
     *
     * Generating a token using either an authorization code or a refresh token allows your integration to act on behalf of a user. You must first [obtain user authorization and get an authorization code](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/#obtain-user-authorization).
     *
     * Access tokens may be up to 4 KB in size, and are only valid for a specified period of time. The expiry time (currently 4 hours) is shown in the endpoint response and is subject to change.

     *
     * Requests to this endpoint require authentication with your client ID and client secret, using _one_ of the following methods:
     *
     * - **Basic access authentication** (Recommended): For [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), the `{credentials}` string must be a Base64 encoded value of `{client id}:{client secret}`.
     * - **Body parameters**: Provide your integration's credentials using the `client_id` and `client_secret` body parameters.
     *
     * **Generate an access token using an authorization code**
     *
     * To generate an access token with an authorization code, you must:
     *
     * - Set `grant_type` to `authorization_code`.
     * - Provide the `code_verifier` value that you generated when creating the user authorization URL.
     * - Provide the authorization code you received after the user authorized the integration.
     *
     * **Generate an access token using a refresh token**
     *
     * Using the `refresh_token` value from a previous user token request, you can get a new access token with the same or smaller scope as the previous one, but with a refreshed expiry time. You will also receive a new refresh token that you can use to refresh the access token again.
     *
     * To refresh an existing access token, you must:
     *
     * - Set `grant_type` to `refresh_token`.
     * - Provide the `refresh_token` from a previous token request.
