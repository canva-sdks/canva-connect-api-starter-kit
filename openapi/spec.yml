        - There might be unannounced breaking changes.
        - Any breaking changes to preview APIs won't produce a new [API version](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/versions/).
        - Public integrations that use preview APIs will not pass the review process, and can't be made available to all Canva users.

        To use this API, your integration must act on behalf of a user that's a member of a [Canva Enterprise](https://www.canva.com/enterprise/) organization.

        Brand templates contain references to image media. You can reference image media by providing the value of `type` with `IMAGE` within the `data` object. The number of

        The Keys API (`connect/keys`) is a security measure you can use to verify the authenticity
        of webhooks you receive from Canva Connect. The Keys API returns a
        [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517#section-2), which you can use to
        decrypt the webhook signature and verify it came from Canva and not a potentially malicious
        actor. This helps to protect your systems from
        [Replay attacks](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/).

        The keys returned by the Keys API can rotate. We recommend you cache the keys you receive
        from this API where possible, and only access this API when you receive a webhook signed
        with an unrecognized key. This allows you to verify webhooks quicker than accessing this API
        every time you receive a webhook.

        it using the link(s) provided.

        The request requires the design ID and the exported file format.

        Supported formats: PDF(`.pdf`), JPG(`.jpg`), PNG(`.png`), GIF(`.gif`),
        PPTX(`.pptx`), and MP4(`.mp4`).

        You can check the status and get the results of export jobs created with this API using the [Get design export job API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/exports/get-design-export-job/).

        NOTE: If you set `export_quality` to `PRO`, the export might fail if the design contains [premium elements](https://www.canva.com/help/premium-elements/), and the calling user either hasn't purchased the elements or isn't on a Canva plan (such as Canva Pro) that has premium features.

        NOTE: Currently, you can't use the export APIs to export video designs. This functionality is being added in the future. For more information on supported export formats for each Canva design type, see the [Overview page](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/exports/).

        This endpoint implements the OAuth 2.0 `token` endpoint, as part of the Authorization Code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). For more information, see [Authentication](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/).

        To generate an access token, you must provide one of the following:

        - An authorization code
        - A refresh token

        Generating a token using either an authorization code or a refresh token allows your integration to act on behalf of a user. You must first [obtain user authorization and get an authorization code](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/#obtain-user-authorization).

        Access tokens may be up to 4 KB in size, and are only valid for a specified period of time. The expiry time (currently 4 hours) is shown in the endpoint response and is subject to change.

        **Endpoint authentication**

        Requests to this endpoint require authentication with your client ID and client secret, using _one_ of the following methods:

        - **Basic access authentication** (Recommended): For [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), the `{credentials}` string must be a Base64 encoded value of `{client id}:{client secret}`.
        - **Body parameters**: Provide your integration's credentials using the `client_id` and `client_secret` body parameters.

        **Generate an access token using an authorization code**

        To generate an access token with an authorization code, you must:

        - Set `grant_type` to `authorization_code`.
        - Provide the `code_verifier` value that you generated when creating the user authorization URL.
        - Provide the authorization code you received after the user authorized the integration.

        **Generate an access token using a refresh token**

        Using the `refresh_token` value from a previous user token request, you can get a new access token with the same or smaller scope as the previous one, but with a refreshed expiry time. You will also receive a new refresh token that you can use to refresh the access token again.

        To refresh an existing access token, you must:

        - Set `grant_type` to `refresh_token`.
        - Provide the `refresh_token` from a previous token request.
